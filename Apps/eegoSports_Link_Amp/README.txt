This directory contains the labstreaminglayer application for the ANT eego sports amplifier. 

Make sure that all necessary drivers are installed and that a ANT license file is pressent at [User]/My Documents/eego. See the amps API documentation for further details. 

This application uses the eego-SDK 1.3.4.. Compiling the source requires Visual Studio 2013 (due to C++11 dependencies in the eego-SDK that are unavailable in VS2008) as well as QT 4.8.
